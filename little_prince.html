<p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class = "makeunderlined"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
<span id = "makeorange" > It seeemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span>
 In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span id = "makered"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower - the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lanmp, even when he is asleep. . ." </span>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
 <span class = makeunderlined > I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
